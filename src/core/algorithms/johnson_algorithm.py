  Johnson's algorithm implementation

  Find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in
  an edge-weighted directed graph.

  It allows some edge weights to be negative numbers,
  but no negative-weight cycles may exist.

  It works by using the *Bellmanâ€“Ford* algorithm to compute a transformation
  of the input graph that removes all negative weights,
  allowing *Dijkstra's* algorithm to be used on the transformed graph.
